Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. In a hospital setting, early identification of high-risk individuals and timely intervention can significantly reduce the impact of stroke on a patient's health and overall healthcare system burden. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a stroke in hospital patients based on various health factors, ultimately enabling healthcare professionals to provide targeted care and resources.

In this project, we will:

- Explore the dataset to understand stroke risk factors in a hospital setting.
- Clean, impute, and encode data for model training.
- Evaluate and select the best model for stroke prediction.
- Optimize the chosen model using hyperparameter tuning.
- Analyze important features and their implications for stroke risk assessment.
- Validate the final model on a test dataset to ensure generalizability and reliability.
- Deploy the model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable, efficient, and real-time predictions.
